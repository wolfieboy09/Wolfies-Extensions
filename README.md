# Wolfies Extensions

I need to update this

Welcome fellow travler!

Here is where all my extensions will be for stuff (For Turbowarp / PenguinMod ). I will host an extension website using Vercel

Current extensions in here:

- Interneter ( Checks if the internet is connected or not )
- CloudedRoblox ( Roblox Cloud API )
- Hypix ( Hypixel API )
- 3Dmathconverter ( 3D math converter where it converts arrays to numbers and backward)
- Screwup ( First-ever extension where I just did random things )
- Muter ( Mutes and unmutes the tab [needs reworking] )
- Airsense ( AirQuality )
- Weatherize ( Weather things )
- Familiar Formulas ( Formulas to diffrent things )
